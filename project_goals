I
it should use the docker sdk
it should be able to create & delete containers  
it should be able to track if a container is deleted
it should maintain its own data in an mongo container (we'll see)
it should detect if its containers are killed and restart them, so it should run schedulers 
it should have a healthcheck to see if the service is running or not


II 
it must have gRPC connections within cli and main service for healthchecks and responses
it must integrate with velocity
it can implement microservices architecture to run on multiple nodes

CLI
vortex up 
vortex apply deployment -f ./file.yaml
vortex show deployment --all
vortex delete deployment <deployment-name>
vortex down
